 sp_naval_shell_hardening_desc: "Development of advanced metallurgical techniques for shell hardening will allows us to increase the penetration capabilities of our large naval shells."  
 
 #Torpedo Cruiser
 sp_naval_torpedo_cruiser: "Torpedo Cruiser"
 sp_naval_torpedo_cruiser_desc: "We can inflict significant damage on our enemies' most important and expensive ships by creating a cruiser designed around torpedo warfare." 
 
 #Super Carrier
 sp_naval_carrier_super: "Large Carriers"
 sp_naval_carrier_super_desc: "A new class of aircraft carriers designed for maximum air combat effectiveness, with the ability to carry and deploy a large number of aircraft. These carriers are much larger than previous ones, allowing for more planes, faster operations, and extended operational range."
