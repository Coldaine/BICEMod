### BASE MISC ABILITIES

		training_time = 175             # Training time - Time in days to train this unit
		#reliability = 0.9       	# Reliability controls how often equipment will suffer random failures.

		#maximum_speed = 0.6           	# Maximum speed acts as a "bonus" mulitipler to the speed determined by the unit equipment in km/h. 
                               			# The formula for the calculated speed is <base speed> * (1 + maximum_speed)km/h; thus a maximum_speed
                               		 	# of 0.5 gives a movement speed 50% faster, a maximum_speed of 2 equals 200% faster, etc.
	
		supply_consumption = 0.04       # Supply consumption determmines how much supply a unit consumes per day

### COST
		#lend_lease_cost = 1            # Space taken up in convoy
		#build_cost_ic = 0.4            # Production Cost - How much factory output this piece of equipment needs



### OFFENSIVE
		#attack = 0.1               	# Firepower - Amount of damage done per attack
		soft_attack = 0.2 		# Soft Attack - How many attacks the unit can make versus enemies with low hardness.
							 #(In this example here, this would mean that the unit would get 10% less Soft #Attack than they would usually get from its equipment
		#hard_attack = -0.5             # Hard Attack - How many attacks the unit can make versus enemies with high hardness
		#air_attack = 1                 # Air Attack - How much damage we can do against airplanes. High Air Attack also helps to counter enemy Air Superiority effects
		#ap_attack = 1        		# Piercing - Having equal or greater Piercing to the targets Armor value allows you to do more damage.
		breakthrough = 0.2              # Breakthrough - How many enemy attacks a unit can attempt to avoid while on the offensive, effectively allowing it to stay on the offense longer.



### DEFENSIVE
		defense = 0.26                   # Defense - How many enemy attacks a unit can avoid whilst on the defensive, effectively allowing it to stay on the defensive longer.
		#max_strength = 2               # HP - Strength represents how much damage this unit can suffer before it is destroyed
		#armor_value = 0                # Armor - Armor that is higher than the opponents Piercing value reduces damage taken and allows more attacks to occur
		#hardness = 0.5                 # Hardness - Represents how much of your divsion is made up of armoured vehicles. High Hardness = High Hard Attacks, Low Soft Attack
		entrenchment = 5                # Entrenchment - The ability to make proper defensive entrenchments before a hostile attack


### UNIQUE		
		#movement = 0.1                  # Movement - Changes the unit's speed
		#experience_loss_factor = 0.1    # Exp. Loss - How much experience is lost in a division when they take casualities and have to replace them
		#casualty_trickleback = 0.2      # Trickleback - The proportion of losses in combat that can be saved and returned to the manpower pool
		#suppression_factor = 0.1        # Suppression bonus - Ability to supress local resistance
		#reliability_factor = 0.05       # Reliability - Applies to an equipment type's reliability and reduces the chance of breakdowns and accidents
		#recon = 1                       # Reconnaissance - Increases the chance that this unit can pick better tactics in battle
		#initiative = 0.2                # Initiative - The higher the initiative, the quicker it can reinforce into battle, and the quick is completes its planning
